<p>The site is coming soon! It was created and developed on Drupal 10 with a custom sub-theme of the Barrio Bootstrap 5 base theme. More regions are added to the sub-theme to make the layouts more flexible. It has many features: responsive design, fullscreen Slideshow, beautiful and multi-style layouts on the home page, page titles on different background images, paragraph and event titles in a circle, HTML Email Newsletters, calendar with varying colors for event catalogs, spam-off contact form, dropdown main menu, etc.</p>
