<div class="websiteIntro">
<p>The custom Printing website was built with Drupal Commerce. I created this site all by myself, even the draft of policies. I learned to make an eCommerce site as a PCI Compliance for Credit Card Payment Security. More features are a full-featured online store system, a customer membership system, and an email notification system. </p>
