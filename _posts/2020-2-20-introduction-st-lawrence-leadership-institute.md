### St. Lawrence Leadership Institute Course

I have taken the St. Lawrence Leadership Institute Course at SUNY Potsdam from the last fall. The group typically meets the first Thursday of each month. There are ten sessions for the course. Class sessions are from 4 pm to 8 pm. Lecture, panel, and yummy dinner are included. 

If you have the desire to become a better-informed citizen, and interested in improving your leadership skills, or will to collaborate with outer community leaders for the advancement of St. Lawrence County and its communities, this course is absolutely the best choice for you!
