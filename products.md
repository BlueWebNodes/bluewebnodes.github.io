            <p>Informational websites, as their name suggests, work in providing information. Informational sites are used by people or businesses to display their work and describe their services, whereas actual transactions and service delivery takes place offline. The main purpose of such a website is to allow your target audience to learn more about you and your business.</p>

            <h2>Drupal 9 &amp; 8 Websites</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/LogoDrupal9.png" alt="Logo"></a></p>  
            <p>Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility and modularity. Drupal powers 2.3% of all websites and has a 4.6% share of the content management system market.</p>
            <p>Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. All Drupal 8 websites I built were updated to Drupal 9. Drupal 9 is the latest version.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/LogoDrupal7.png" alt="Logo"></a></p>  
            <p>If you have a Drupal 7 website needs maintanence or recreation to Drupal 9, I can help. Drupal community support will no longer be available after November 2021, but there’s a Drupal 7 Extended Support program which will continue to provide security updates for Drupal 7 core and certain contrib modules. We have created many Drupal 7 websites, but most of them are not online anymore.</p>
